    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tacos are the national dish of Mexico, dating back to the Mexican silver mines of the 18th century, when the word taco referred to gunpowder that was wrapped in a piece of paper and inserted into rocks. It was used to excavate the precious ore from mines and was called tacos de minero or miner's tacos. Today, the word is widely known to signify the leading street food and fast food item in Mexico â€“ thin, flat griddle-baked tortillas topped with numerous fillings, folded and eaten without any utensils.</p>
